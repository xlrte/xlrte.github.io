We simply want to be able to say _\\"I need a database/message topic/storage bucket/etc\\"_.\\n\\nThis is precisely the problem `xlrte` solves: you define your services, and tell the tool what dependent resources (like a database) they need, and `xlrte` figures out the rest, like setting up secrets, secure networks, identity & permission management etc.\\nYou can naturally step in and fine-tune resources, especially scaling parameters, but out of the box, it comes with sensible defaults and enough resources for testing- and development environments.\\n\\nAt the outset, we support `Google Cloud Platform` and the following services:\\n\\n* `Cloud Run` as a service runtime (Cloud Functions coming soon)\\n* `Cloud SQL` as a database\\n* `Pub/Sub` as messaging middleware \\n* `Cloud Storage` for block storage\\n\\nWe will extend the coverage of both GCP services, as well as work towards supporting _AWS Serverless services_ as well as likely Kubernetes based service runtimes in the future. The core CLI has an extensible API, which means anyone can create their own resource & cloud provider implementations (API does not come with any stability promises before a `1.0` release though).\\n\\nTo learn more, please refer to [our documentation](http://localhost:3000/docs/intro)!\\nFor further help, please feel free to ask questions on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PakzubspHR) or [Github](https://github.com/xlrte/core)."}]}')}}]);
